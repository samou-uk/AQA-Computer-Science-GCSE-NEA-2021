Airport Profitability Problem

README - Author : Sam Ou

To run either versions of the program, you will need to install the python modules Pandas and this can be done through
Anaconda or just in terminal/cmd (depending on whether you are a Mac or PC user).

For this program, you can't use the original version of the Airports.txt, use my file Airport.txt instead and the
program will run without any issues.

Here are the differences between my file and the original file:

My version of the txt file:

Airport Code,Airport Name,Liverpool John Lennon,Bournemouth International
JFK,John F Kennedy International,5326,5486
ORY,Paris-Orly,629,379
MAD,Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas,1428,1151
AMS,Amsterdam Schiphol,526,489
CAI,Cairo International,3779,3584

The original version of the txt file:

JFK,John F Kennedy International,5326,5486
ORY,Paris-Orly,629,379
MAD,Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas,1428,1151
AMS,Amsterdam Schiphol,526,489
CAI,Cairo International,3779,3584

As you can see above ^^^ my file has an extra line for the columns and this is fundamental for the running of the
file-dependent version of my program.

I reiterate once again, the program which relies on the txt file WILL NOT work with the original file. If you can't use
my file, then I have altered the code slightly in another version, so that you won't need any file to run the program,
and the data in this version is stored in the program.


Enjoy :)
